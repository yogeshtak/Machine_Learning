    "# Predicting  the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning 🚜\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a \"blue book\" for bulldozers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** The goal is to build a ML model which minimises RMSLE\n",
    "\n",
